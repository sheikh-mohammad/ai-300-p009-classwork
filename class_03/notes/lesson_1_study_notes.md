# Study Notes: Teach Claude Your Way of Working

## Summary

This lesson introduces Claude Skills, which are personal style guides that allow you to teach Claude your preferred way of working once, so it can apply your preferences automatically in future tasks. Skills transform Claude from a generic assistant to a personalized one that understands your specific tone, structure, and preferences for different types of tasks.

## Key Terms and Definitions

- **Skills**: Personal style guides that capture how you approach specific tasks - your tone, structure, and preferences - so Claude creates output that sounds like you
- **Personal Style Guide**: A documented approach to specific tasks that preserves your personal touch in Claude's output
- **Automatic Activation**: When Claude recognizes when your style guide applies and loads the skill automatically
- **Explicit Invocation**: When you specifically mention a skill by name for Claude to load it
- **Matrix Analogy**: The concept that skills work like programs uploaded directly to your brain, giving instant expertise (like in The Matrix)

## Main Content

Skills solve the problem of repeatedly explaining your preferences to Claude. Instead of explaining your LinkedIn post style every time, you define it once in a skill, and Claude remembers it. The lesson explains that skills can be activated in two ways:

1. Automatic activation: Claude recognizes when your style guide applies
2. Explicit invocation: You mention the skill by name

The lesson describes the Skills Lab which contains different types of skills:
- Those that work without Python (internal-comms, brand-guidelines)
- Those that require Python (docx, pdf, pptx, xlsx)

A practical example is given of a "Study Notes Assistant" skill that processes raw lecture notes into structured study materials with summaries, key concepts, practice questions, and quick review sections.

The lesson outlines everyday applications of skills for social media, studying, personal organization, and communication, emphasizing that skills save time and ensure consistency.
