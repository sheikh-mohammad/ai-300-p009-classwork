## Response Text

Created a project constitution for the Python calculator project with requirements for uv and type hints. The constitution establishes core principles including type safety first, dependency management with uv, test-first approach, minimal viable calculator, error handling, and command-line first interface. It also defines the technology stack and development workflow.

## Outcome

Successfully created .specify/memory/constitution.md with version 1.0.0, establishing governance for the Python calculator project with uv and type hints requirements.
